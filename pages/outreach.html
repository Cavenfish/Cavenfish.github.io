    <h1> 1st UCF Raspberry Jam </h1>
    I put together a free event to help people develop better knowledge of
    Python coding, Raspberry Pi's and Circuit analysis. Where both undergraduate
    and graduate students presented projects they completed using Raspberry Pi's.

    <h1> iSTEM and Career Day at UCF </h1>
    I have volunteered for every iSTEM and Career day event at UCF since  2016.
    These events always bring me great joy and I plan to continue volunteering
    at all events for as long as I remain at UCF. To the left and right are
    pictures of me demonstrating the 'Bed of Broken Glass'  stunt. This shows
    the audience how something that may seem dangerous is actually quite safe
    when we know the Laws of Physics. Here, the concept shows that with large
    surface area pressure is reduced allowing for large forces (my weight) to be
    supported by the glass without puncturing my bare-feet. <br>

    <h1> Bed of Nails </h1>
    Below, is a video of me demonstrating (with the help of another student and
    Dr. Efthimiou) the 'Bed of Nails' stunt. This stunt demonstrates the same
    physical concept of pressure, however on a much more extreme scale.  This
    stunt involves sandwiching two students between two beds of nails then
    breaking a cinder block on top of the second bed of nails.  We also let an
    audience member stand atop a flat piece of wood to show that there are no
    tricks at play when smashing the cinder block.<br>
