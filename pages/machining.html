    <h1> Spectroscopy Sample Holder with Radiation Shield </h1>
    I designed in SolidWorks both the sample holder and radiation shield, then
    machined both from stock metal in the UCF physics department machine shop.
    The sample holder is made from Oxygen-Free Copper (OFC), which due to its
    reduced level of impurities possess the high thermal and electrical
    conductive properties of elemental copper. The thermal conductivity is of
    particular importance to use, since the sample holder is attached to a
    cryostat which can bring our sample down to 10 Kelvin. The radiation shield
    is meant to absorb external thermal radiation before it reached our sample
    holder or cryostat, allowing for more constant low temperatures. Our sample
    holder is made to hold a 1 inch diameter KBr window, on which we deposit
    ices for irradiation experiments. The KBr window is allows us to perform
    transmission mode Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectroscopy on our
    irradiated ices, in search of product formation within the ice. The steel
    cap in the front of the sample holder is electrically isolated from the rest
    of the sample holder and grounded to prevent charge build up when irradiating
    our sample.<br>

    <h1> Thick Lens Experiment </h1>
    To the left is a Thick Lens Experiment I built during my undergraduate
    degree. I built the tracks and carts from scratch, using only the equipment
    in our departments machine shop and stock aluminum. The lens holding fixture
    were pre-made however I made small modifications for them to work for the
    desired purpose. This is currently used as one of the required experiments
    in the 'Advanced Laboratory' course at UCF. <br>
