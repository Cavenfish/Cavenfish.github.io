**Abstract:**
Here, we investigated the electron irradiation of astrophysical ice analogs in an Ultra-High
Vacuum (UHV) chamber with base pressure of 3x10-11 torr. Gas was introduced to the chamber,
then condensed on a sample holder, which was then irradiated with a 2keV electrons over
various time intervals. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra were taken before and after
each interval of irradiation, allowing us to monitor product formation with the ice. We then
performed temperature programed desorption (TPD) while monitoring the desorbed products
with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS). Our work presents a better understanding of the
dynamics involved in the irradiation of airless bodies in the solar system, and elucidates the
intermediate reactions occurring during radiation induced processing of ices. We also present
findings that could show how biomolecules, such as amino acids, form on the surface of
Enceladus through the interaction of the magnetosphere with plume material from Enceladus.
