I'm currently a Physics PhD candidate at the University of Central Florida (UCF),
working under Dr. Christopher J. Bennett. I'm also the chairman of the student
chapter of the American Vacuum Society (AVS) at UCF, visit our chapter
[website](https://ucf.avs.org) to see all the exiting things we are up to. My research
interests include irradiation of astrophysically relevant ices and quantum
chemistry calculations of spectroscopic properties of gas-phase molecules.
